                        <h4 class="atlas-travel-subheading">Why do I need travel medical insurance?</h4>
                        <p>
                            International travel can represent financial risk. The benefits of many standard medical insurance policies do not apply beyond the borders of your home country. An Atlas travel medical insurance plan can be the difference between a trip ruined by unexpected illness or injury, versus a trip with access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected strikes.

                                        This HCCMIS member was traveling overseas when he was bitten by an insect and developed an infection leading to multilobar pneumonia and exudative tonsillitis. His illness required 11 days in a Bangkok hospital. Unfortunately the language barrier made diagnosing him difficult, and hospital employees regularly brought him bills and demanded cash payment. HCCMIS was able to arrange direct payment with the hospital, providing our member peace of mind about his mounting medical expenses.

                                        Multilobar pneumonia occurs when there is a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection in two or more lobes of the lungs. It is generally thought more severe than pneumonia affecting a single lobe, and can require hospitalization.1 Symptoms include a cough, fever, chills, general weakness, nausea/vomiting, and an elevated heartbeat. Bacterial pneumonia is usually treated with antibiotics, whereas viral pneumonia is treated with antiviral medications.2

                                        Tonsillitis is inflammation and infection of the tonsils, two lymph tissue masses located on either side in back of the throat.3 It is usually caused by a bacteria or virus, and its primary symptom is a very sore throat, which can be severe enough to cause swelling of the tonsils and airway blockage. It may also cause fever, chills, earaches, headaches, and other symptoms.4
